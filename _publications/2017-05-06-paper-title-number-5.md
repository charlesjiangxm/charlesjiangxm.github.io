excerpt: 'It is that one kind can be combined with multi-motion object detection algorithms the invention belongs to the moving object segmentation field in Digital Image Processing, eliminates the universal method of the ghost produced in video flowing.Background segment before the present invention is carried out to video stream application moving object segmentation algorithm first；Pre-treatment is carried out with expansion algorithm using medium filtering to prospect masking-out again, then convolution is carried out with Scatter operators and prospect masking-out, the moving object foreground picture of connection is broken up with dynamic；The renewal that the update method based on spatial simlanty carries out background model is reused, next frame is finally read in circular treatment.Beneficial technique effect：The present invention has the advantages that quickly ghost can be eliminated in the case where verification and measurement ratio is higher.'
